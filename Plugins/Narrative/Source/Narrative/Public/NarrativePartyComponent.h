/**
 * A Narrative component intended to be shared by multiple clients. This allows for some very cool functionality, teammates
 * can play quests and dialogues together with each other. Use AddPartyMember and RemovePartyMember to setup your party. 
 * 
 * QUESTS: Quests began on the party component will be shown on all party members UI, and any player in the party can complete quest tasks.
 * 
 * DIALOGUE: Dialogues began on the party component will begin for all players, and all players will see the dialogue in sync - if a player selects
 * a dialogue option all party members will see that player say the line - this behaviour can be modified in the components settings. 
 * 
 * You should put this component on an actor that replicates to all of your team members. The Game State is a great place for this,
 * however if your game requires multiple different parties you'll want to make a ASquad etc that derives AInfo to hold all your team members
 * and manage them, and put a party component there instead of the game state.
